**Abstract**  
DeepSeek-V3 represents a significant advancement in open-source machine learning models, achieving performance comparable to top-tier closed-source systems. The model is distinguished by its efficient training requirements, needing only 2.788 million hours on an H800 GPU, and its large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework with 671 billion parameters. It uses innovative training objectives and optimizations, such as Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) and FP8 mixed precision training, to improve model efficiency and prediction accuracy. The DeepSeek-V3 architecture incorporates advanced techniques to enhance load balance and inference efficiency, positioning it as a state-of-the-art solution for large-scale language model training.
