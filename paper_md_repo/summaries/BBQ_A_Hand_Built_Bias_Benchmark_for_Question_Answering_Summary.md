# Detailed Report on "The Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)"

## Abstract

"The Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)" is a dataset meticulously crafted to assess and quantify the extent of social biases present in question-answering models. This dataset is particularly focused on biases against protected classes across nine social dimensions within U.S. English-speaking contexts. The evaluation framework of BBQ encompasses two pivotal tasks: assessing model responses in under-informative contexts to determine bias reflection, and evaluating whether biases can override correct answers in adequately informative contexts. This paper, authored by Vidgen et al. (2021), also draws attention to social biases prevalent in language models and the potential harm they pose to marginalized groups when deployed in real-world applications. The study employs BBQ to evaluate models like UnifiedQA, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3, revealing their tendencies to resort to biases when adequate context is unavailable. BBQ serves as a critical tool for bias identification, emphasizing the need for contextually diverse datasets in model training and evaluation.

## Introduction to Social Bias in QA Models

Social biases in language models have been consistently observed across various NLP tasks, such as language generation and coreference resolution, as highlighted by previous studies like Sheng et al. (2019) and Rudinger et al. (2018). These biases, when ingrained within models, pose a risk of reinforcing stereotypes and causing harm, particularly to marginalized groups. The BBQ dataset addresses this by providing a structured means to evaluate and understand these biases within question-answering systems.

## Dataset Design and Structure

### Contexts and Questions

The BBQ dataset is structured around sets of questions designed to evaluate the impact of ambiguous and disambiguated contexts on model responses. Each question set varies two elements: context ambiguity and question type, which includes negative and non-negative versions. For example, questions like "Who likely planted the bomb?" are designed to observe biases when switching potential answers between "Christian" and "Muslim."

### Stereotypes and Assumptions

The dataset incorporates various societal biases, such as:

- **Cognitive Abilities and Age**: Stereotyping older adults as forgetful.
- **Intelligence and Physical Disability**: Associating physical disabilities with lower intelligence.
- **Gender and Mathematics**: The stereotype that girls are poor at math.
- **Technology Proficiency**: Assumptions about individuals' familiarity with computers.
- **Substance Use**: Differentiating between drug users and abstainers.
- **Parenting and Personality Traits**: Categorizing individuals as inattentive or caring, greedy, or giving.
- **Health Status**: Biased assumptions about HIV status.

These biases are explored across nine categories: age, disability status, gender identity, nationality, physical appearance, race/ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.

## Methodology

### Dataset Validation

The BBQ dataset undergoes rigorous validation by experts and crowdworkers, ensuring high accuracy and reliability in capturing social biases. Annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk validate bias examples, achieving a human accuracy rate of 95.7%.

### Model Evaluation

The study evaluates the performance of models such as UnifiedQA, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3 on the BBQ dataset. The models are assessed based on their responses in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts, with accuracy and bias scores calculated to quantify their reliance on biases.

### Template Design

Templates are designed to highlight specific biases, featuring two questions, answer options, partial contexts, and disambiguating contexts. These templates are inspired by known biases and structured to minimize the influence of specific phrasings.

## Experimental Results

### Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: UnifiedQA with RACE-style inputs achieved the highest accuracy, particularly in contexts with clear answers.
- **Bias Scores**: Models exhibited higher bias scores in ambiguous contexts, reflecting a tendency to align responses with social biases.
- **Specific Biases**: Biases related to physical appearance were notably pronounced, while race and orientation biases showed less variation.

### Intersectional Biases

Intersectional biases, such as those combining race and gender, were less consistently observed, indicating a potential area for improvement in model sensitivity to multiple identity aspects.

## Discussion

While BBQ provides a robust framework for bias identification, bias scores must be interpreted cautiously. A zero bias score does not imply the absence of bias but rather an equal tendency across bias and non-bias contexts. Additionally, the dataset's US-centric design limits its applicability to other cultural contexts.

## Conclusion

BBQ contributes significantly to identifying contexts where models exhibit biases, thereby aiding efforts to mitigate these biases. The research underscores the importance of diverse and contextually relevant datasets in model training and evaluation to prevent the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes.

## Ethical Considerations

BBQ is a research tool meant for assessing biases within US contexts and should not be used as a definitive measure across different domains. Its proper use and interpretation are crucial to avoid misleading conclusions about model behavior.
